# MY HABIT

**BUDGET TRACKER APP**
This is my first portfolio project and the app is programmed to simulate the real life budget tracking app like **wallet**

## OBJECTIVES

**This project would solve the following:**

- Inefficient money management
- Overspending

- Financial stress

**What this Portfolio Project will Not Solve:

While this Budget app for Android can help users manage their finances effectively, it will not address the following:

- Automatically make financial decisions for users
- Provide personalized tax planning or legal advice.

- Individuals who want to gain better control over their personal finances.
- Students looking to manage their finances during their academic journey.
